        <h2>Qualifications and experience</h2>
        <li>Bachelors degree in Computing from worcester univesity 2:1 with Hons</li>
        <p>This one is pretty simple, did quite a lot of work within various lnguages (C#, HTML, JS and limited .Net being the main few)</p>
        <li>5 years of techichal support experience working with JS SDKs and Webserices</li>
        <p>This one is a little more complex! over the last 5 years I have ende up focusing a lot more in the area of front end web development and the skills that go alongside that.
          A strong focus on Raw JS and understanding how to access and manipulate web services has allowed me to increase my technichal skillset thorugh practical application of custom solutions for customers.
        This role has also allowed me to gain an understaind in using SQL to interrogate databases and write and maintain my own basic web pages.</p>
